# Data-Pipelines-with-Redis
A project on Data Pipelines with Redis.

## Data Pipeline for a Telecommunications project

This project is a data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads data from a CSV file to a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently and securely. The pipeline includes a monitoring and alerting system that sends an email notification when data is not successfully written in the PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements

•	Python 3.6 or higher

•	PostgreSQL

•	Redis

•	pandas

•	psycopg2-binary

•	redis

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-data-pipeline.git Install the required packages using pip
pip install pandas psycopg2-binary redis Create a PostgreSQL database and update the database connection parameters in main.py
Update the Redis connection parameters in main.py
Usage To run the data pipeline, run the following command:
python main.py This will run the data pipeline, which consists of three stages:
Extract data from a CSV file and cache it in Redis Transform the data and store it in a pandas DataFrame Load the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database
Best Practices This project follows several best practices for building efficient and secure data pipelines, including:

•	Using Redis to cache data for faster retrieval

•	Using a PostgreSQL database for secure and reliable data storage

•	Using pandas for efficient data transformation

•	Implementing a try-except block for error handling and alerting

•	Separating configuration parameters from code
